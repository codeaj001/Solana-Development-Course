# Introduction to Rust Syntax

## A Quick Brush-Up on Rust Basics âœ¨

### Variable Declaration in Rust
Rustâ€™s syntax is clean and intuitive, making it approachable for both beginners and seasoned developers. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of variable declarations and functions:

#### 1. String
```rust
let message = "Hello, world!";
```

#### 2. Integer
```rust
let x = 42;
```

#### 3. Float
```rust
let y = 0.5;
```

#### 4. Boolean
```rust
let z = true;
```

#### 5. Character
```rust
let letter = 'a';
```

### Writing a Function in Rust
Functions are a core part of any program. Hereâ€™s an example of a simple function that adds two numbers:

```rust
fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
```
> Note: Functions in Rust explicitly define parameter types and return types, ensuring safety and clarity.
